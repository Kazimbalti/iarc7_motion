# Using the weight of the thrust stand (389 grams or so with the F80). No accounting for the disadvantaged lever.
417123.00

# Measured with a tattu and CNHL battery pack hanging off of the F80 when the stand
# was in a vertical position. 2583g total. Disadvantaged lever is being used.
# When measured the lever factor was 16.72/12 (long (horizontal) / short (vertical)
# (310556.71 * 16.75/12) / 417123.00 = 1.039 implying that there is only a 4% difference
# between the two measurements.
# The below value will be used since a larger weight was used and it accounts for the
# disadvantaged lever
